Or install it yourself as:

    extend InterfaceRegistry::AbstractInterface
    method_interface :method1
    method_interface :method2
end

# require adapters
require 'test_interface/adapter_1'
```

Implement an Adapter

```ruby
# test_interface/adapter_1.rb
module TestInterface
    class Adapter1
        include TestInterface

        aattr_accessor :attr1
        aattr_accessor :attr2

        def method1
        # do stuff ...
        end

        def method2
        # do stuff ...
        end

    end
end
```
